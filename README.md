## ðŸ“¥ Input Description
The following test cases are available:
- **Input 1 & 2**: Provided as samples in the assignment.
- **Input 3**: Another sample from the assignment.
- **Input 4 & 5**: Custom test cases created for additional verification.
- **Input 5**: 7x7 grid.
- **Input 6**: 9x9 grid.
- **Input 7**: 11Ã—11 grid.
- **Input 8**: 13Ã—13 grid.
- **Input 9**: 17Ã—17 grid.
- **Input 10**: 20Ã—20 grid.

Each test case follows the standard Hashiwokakero format and adheres to the puzzle's logical constraints.
